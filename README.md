# JavaScript Games and Projects

This repository contains three interactive JavaScript-based games built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (Strict Mode)**. Each project demonstrates key JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic. Explore the projects and learn how they work!
